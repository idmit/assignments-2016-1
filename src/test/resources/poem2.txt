When I first met you 
I felt like I had known you forever, 
telling you my secrets 
and what I didn't want ever. 
you listened to me 
I bet you thought I'd never end, 
who would have thought 
we would become more than just friends. 
Over a period of time, 
I got to know the real you. 
A boy so caring and gentle, 
with a heart so true. 
You've survived your life 
with hurt and loneliness by your side. 
I told you I'd never leave 
because of the feelings I have inside. 
I know you 
like no one I have ever known, 
and sometimes I wonder 
what I'd do if you were gone? 
So I have decided 
time answers all. 
If it is meant to be 
time will remove the wall. 
I love the way we are together, 
you can always make me smile. 
Will it ever really be forever? 
I guess I will have to wait awhile. 
Time will reveal what lies ahead 
but always remember 
what I have said. 
Meeting you has changed my life 
and I really love you so, 
the feelings I feel for you 
I am never letting go. 
Remember me always 
and I will too. 
I always think of 
me and you.
